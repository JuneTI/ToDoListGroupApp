# ToDoListGroupApp
I made a rough draft of what the entire project could look like including a Task, toDo, and driver file. It is very simple for now but I wanted to get an idea of how we can start putting the GUI part together. 
Yet to complete:
  - implement sorting methods in toDo
  - Clean up the GUI in the Main class/change colors/change font etc
  - Add checkboxes next to each Task printed on the screen
  - Event-driven stuff (making buttons and text fields work in collaboration with the toDo class)
